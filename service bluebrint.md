Service Blueprinting
Use service design to create processes that are core to your digital experience and everything that supports it

Services rarely get the same attention as products. Even in the world of computer provided services, our resources (time, budget, man-power) are spent on customer-facing outputs, while overlooking the experience of the employees and/or service providers.

Services create intangible value through exchanges between people and either other people or props, where the “props” can be software, objects, collateral, or other carriers of a user experience. Service design is the design of those exchanges.
